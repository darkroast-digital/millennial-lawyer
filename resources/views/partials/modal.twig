        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>I am a litigation attorney working at a mid-sized law firm based in Michigan, United States. I practice personal injury with a specialization in handling commercial truck wrecks, and have obtained some of the most significant trucking litigation results reported in Michigan in recent years.</p>
        <p>This is my personal blog. It’s focused on “growth” for millennial professionals. My philosophy is: if we’re not growing, we’re regressing.</p>
        <p>I write about lifestyle, professional development, and personal development. Sometimes I write about things that are a little obscure and may not fit nicely into these categories. I always write about, and share, new resources I come across, and anything that I’ve personally found helpful.</p>
        <p>My goal is to create meaningful, impactful content, that can immediately add value to the personal and professional lives of the people who read it.</p>
        <p>Earlier in my career I scoured the internet, books, and litigation magazines, for anything I could find to learn to be a better lawyer, a better professional, and a better person. Despite my best efforts, I never really found <em>exactly</em> what I was looking for. There was nothing out there that spoke <em>directly</em> to a millennial professional – or at least, not credibly. In other words: there was a gap. So, I figured why not fill the void? If you’re a young professional looking for great resources, this blog is for you!</p>
        <p>I don’t claim to know it all. In fact, I don’t claim to know anything at all. I’m just a guy from a small town who has done pretty well for himself. Now I hope to pass along all the resources and things I’ve picked up which helped me get to where I am today.</p>
        <p>I typically post two to three times per week. Make sure to subscribe via RSS or email so you never miss a post! Thanks for reading.</p>
        <p>Truly yours,</p>
        <p>Jordan</p>

        <h4>BIOGRAPHY</h4>
        <p>I was not always successful. I grew up in a small town in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. I spent the majority of my early adult years playing World of Warcraft and going to night clubs. An odd combination, I know.</p>
        <p>I somehow squeaked my way into a mid-sized college in Ontario, Canada, where I studied business administration; and then English; and finally, political science. I actually finished political science! By the time I was done switching programs, it took me five and a half years to complete my degree.</p>
        <p>I boxed all through college and put together an impressive amateur boxing career. After watching Entourage starring Jeremy Piven faithfully for 9 seasons, I decided to combine my love of boxing and Ari Gold. I applied to law school with a plan to become a sports and entertainment lawyer.</p>
        <p>In 2010 I was accepted into a law school in Michigan with a great alumni network all throughout the state. It was a great time to be in Michigan. Detroit was just starting to turn the corner, and a lot of major films were being shot in the city because of great film incentives designed to stimulate the state economy. It was perfect. I was going to law school to be a sports and entertainment lawyer, right in the middle of a mini-boom in film production in Michigan.</p>
        <p>But, as they say, timing is everything. The film incentives program ended during my first year, and so did all the filming that had been going on. And thus, ended my lofty ambitions of being the next Ari Gold.</p>
        <p>During the summer of my first year, I went back to Canada and worked in a factory packing car rims into shipping boxes. When school started back in the fall, I was too embarrassed to apply for any on-campus interviews. While my classmates had been clerking for judges, volunteering at the prosecutor’s office, or interning at some boutique law firm all summer, I was packing rims in cardboard boxes.</p>
        <p>But I am a staunch believer that everything happens for a reason. I believe that almost as much as I believe in clichés. I applied for the spring on-campus interviews rather than the fall, so I could do a class credit internship in the interim and have some legal experience when applying. There were only a few law firms that came to spring recruitment that year. One of them was crazy enough to hire me. The firm that hired me as a doe-eyed law student, is the firm I still work for today all these years later.</p>
        <p>I was licensed to practice law in Michigan in 2013. I started handling commercial trucking cases right away. Luckily, I was under the tutelage of one of the best plaintiff’s trucking lawyers in the country.</p>
        <p>In 2014 I started a small tech startup with four friends, five thousand dollars, and a case of beer. This was right around the time I got serious about personal and professional development. I started working on myself, my practice, and my lifestyle, and things really took off.</p>
        <p>I will not bore you with the details, but I will share with you the highlights. In 2016 I had three of the top reported truck accident litigation results in Michigan – $3.3M, $2M, and $1M, respectively. In 2017 I achieved two of the top results in the state of $1.63M and $1.25M.</p>
        <p>I have been named a Michigan Super Lawyers Rising Star every year since 2014. In 2015 I was named one of Michigan’s top “Up & Coming Lawyers” by a major legal publication. I have been featured as a guest speaker on trucking industry blogs; I’ve been invited to speak at multiple legal seminars across the country; I’ve lectured with the Michigan Institute of Continuing Legal Education six times and counting; and most importantly – I’ve done right by my clients, my co-workers, my friends, and my family.</p>
        <p>By the way – remember my small tech startup that started with five thousand dollars and a case of beer? In January of 2018 we sold the company for $4.2M in cash and stock.</p>
        <p>I’m not exceptionally smart. I’m not exceptionally talented. There were many lucky breaks along the way, but mostly, there were a lot of good resources. And that is what I aim to share with you. The resources, the tips, and the role models, who helped me along this remarkable journey.</p>
